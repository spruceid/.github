# SpruceID

Digital trust infrastructure for government services.

We build secure identity solutions that power real-world credential issuance, holding, presentation, and verification — from mobile driver's licenses to professional qualifications. Our open source tools help agencies deliver faster, more secure resident experiences.

## Standards

Our implementations help test and refine identity specifications at ISO (18013-5, 18013-7), W3C (Verifiable Credentials), OpenID Foundation (OpenID4VC/VP), and IETF before widespread adoption.

Some of these libraries were developed with support from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (contract 70RSAT24T00000011), building open-source, privacy-preserving digital credential infrastructure for standards-based interoperability across government services.
